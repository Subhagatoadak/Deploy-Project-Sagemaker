# Deploy-Project-Sagemaker
This is the solution to the final project of Deep Learning Nanodegree Udacity.

## Project Overview

In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
